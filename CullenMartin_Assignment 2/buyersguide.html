					<h2>Strings</h2>
				</div>
					
				<div class="col_text">
					<p>The strings you choose can drastically affect the type of sound your guitar produces. Nylon strings have a more soft and mellow tone making 
					them ideal for playing classical pieces and they are also very easy on your fingers, which is why they are my personal recommendation for a beginner.<br><br>
					Steel strings are the standard for electric guitars yet can also be found on many acoustic guitars as well. When applied to acoustic guitars, they are 
					generally louder than nylon and are ideal for playing genres such as folk and blues.

					<h2>Guitar types</h2>
				</div>
					
				<div class="col_text">
					<p>Acoustic: these guitars use their hollow bodies to amplify the sound of their strings and are the ideal guitar for beginners since 
					they don’t require any additional equipment such as amplifiers. There are many different types of acoustic guitar that you can buy. 
					Classical guitars use nylon strings and are a good all-rounder, allowing you to play most genres without too much trouble. 
					Twelve string guitars are an alternative that almost exclusively use steel strings and provide a much “fuller” sound with the downside of
					being difficult to tune and maintain, due to there being twice as many stings to worry about. These guitars are also much harder to play 
					using fingerstyle as you need to be very careful with your finger placement in comparison to a regular 6-string. If you are thinking of buying 
					an acoustic, it is recommended that you buy one with a plain wooden body as paint can mess with how the sound resonates within the guitar itself, leading to a worsened sound quality.<br><br>
					Electric: these guitars are a staple of rock and metal, with an often aggressive sound that excels in a band environment. The downside of these guitars 
					is that they lack versatility and must be played through an amplifier in order for their sound to be heard.

					<h2>The capo</h2>
				</div>
					
				<div class="col_text">
					<p>A capo is a small device that clamps down on the strings of the guitar in order to raise its pitch. They are fairly cheap and are very commonly used by artists of all genres.
					Being able to change the pitch of your playing can be very helpful if you enjoy singing, as the capo allows you to play within your vocal range with little adjustment.
